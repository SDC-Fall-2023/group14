Line Tracker

React Native!	
What does this app do?
Lists all of the bars @ UW Madison
Sorting feature to see what's the busiest to least (different filters avail) “What’s Hot?”
Each bar has its own “tile”, on this tile it lists how long the line is, how “popping” it is, is it a generally freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior bar (basically odds of getting in as that year)
How are we keeping track of people bars: 
People need to be saying they are in line or inside to get this data
Can use Google Maps data to see how busy they say it is


Possible features(will implement once bare minimum): 
Year in review (basically keeps track of what bars you frequent most, how long you spent there, what days of the week you went the most, etc.)
Ability to take a picture to see what the bar currently looks like, so people can see real-time what the atmosphere is like
